A hybrid Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) solver combining a Rust backend, JAX automatic differentiation, and Python orchestration. Solves MINLP problems via NLP-based spatial Branch & Bound {cite:p}`Land1960,Belotti2013` with JIT-compiled objective/gradient/Hessian evaluation.

## Architecture

```
Model.solve()  -->  Python orchestrator  -->  Rust TreeManager (B&B engine)
                        |                          |
                  JAX NLPEvaluator           Node pool / branching / pruning
                  NLP backends:              Zero-copy numpy arrays (PyO3)
                    ripopt  (Rust IPM, PyO3)
                    ipm     (pure-JAX, vmap batch)  [default]
                    cyipopt (Ipopt)
```

**Rust backend** (`crates/discopt-core`): Expression IR, Branch & Bound tree (node pool, branching, pruning), .nl file parser, FBBT/presolve (interval arithmetic, probing, Big-M simplification).

**JAX layer** (`python/discopt/_jax`): DAG compiler mapping modeling expressions to JAX primitives, JIT-compiled NLP evaluator (objective, gradient, Hessian, constraint Jacobian), McCormick convex/concave relaxations {cite:p}`McCormick1976` (21 functions including sigmoid, softplus, tanh), and a relaxation compiler with vmap support.

**Solver wrappers** (`python/discopt/solvers`): ripopt (Rust IPM via PyO3), cyipopt NLP wrapper for Ipopt {cite:p}`Wachter2006`, HiGHS LP and MILP wrappers with warm-start support (MILP used by the LOA decomposition solver).

**Neural network embedding** (`python/discopt/nn`): embeds trained feedforward networks as algebraic MINLP constraints {cite:p}`Ceccon2022` via full-space (smooth activations), ReLU big-M MILP {cite:p}`Anderson2020`, and reduced-space strategies; interval arithmetic bound propagation; ONNX model import.

**Generalized disjunctive programming** (`python/discopt/_jax/gdp_reformulate.py`): reformulates GDP models — `BooleanVar`, propositional logic operators, `either_or()`, `if_then()` — into standard MINLP via big-M, multiple big-M (LP-tightened), convex hull, or Logic-based Outer Approximation.

**Orchestrator** (`python/discopt/solver.py`): End-to-end `Model.solve()` connecting all components. At each B&B node: solve continuous NLP relaxation with the interior-point method {cite:p}`Nocedal2006`, prune infeasible nodes, fathom integer-feasible solutions, branch on most fractional variable.

## Quick Start

```python
from discopt import Model

m = Model("example")
x = m.continuous("x", lb=0, ub=5)
y = m.continuous("y", lb=0, ub=5)
z = m.binary("z")

m.minimize(x**2 + y**2 + z)
m.subject_to(x + y >= 1)
m.subject_to(x**2 + y <= 3)

result = m.solve()
print(result.status)     # "optimal"
print(result.objective)  # 0.5
print(result.x)          # {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.5, "z": 0.0}
```

## NLP Backend Comparison

discopt supports three NLP solver backends, each with different strengths:

| Backend         | Implementation    | Use Case                                   |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `ipm` (default) | Pure-JAX IPM      | B&B inner loop; GPU-batched via `jax.vmap` |
| `ripopt`        | Rust IPM via PyO3 | Single-problem NLP; fastest wall-clock     |
| `cyipopt`       | Ipopt via cyipopt | Single-problem NLP; most robust            |

```python
result = model.solve(nlp_solver="ripopt")   # Rust IPM
result = model.solve(nlp_solver="ipm")      # Pure-JAX (default)
result = model.solve(nlp_solver="cyipopt")  # Ipopt
```
