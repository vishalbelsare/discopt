[![Nightly](https://github.com/jkitchin/discopt/actions/workflows/nightly.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jkitchin/discopt/actions/workflows/nightly.yml)

A hybrid Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) solver combining a Rust backend, JAX automatic differentiation, and Python orchestration. Solves MINLP problems via NLP-based spatial Branch & Bound with JIT-compiled objective/gradient/Hessian evaluation.

## Architecture

```
Model.solve()  -->  Python orchestrator  -->  Rust TreeManager (B&B engine)
                        |                          |
                  JAX NLPEvaluator           Node pool / branching / pruning
                  cyipopt (Ipopt)            Zero-copy numpy arrays (PyO3)
```

**Rust backend** (`crates/discopt-core`): Expression IR, Branch & Bound tree (node pool, branching, pruning), .nl file parser, FBBT/presolve (interval arithmetic, probing, Big-M simplification).

**Rust-Python bindings** (`crates/discopt-python`): PyO3 bindings with zero-copy numpy array transfer for the B&B tree manager, expression IR, batch dispatch, and .nl parser.

**JAX layer** (`python/discopt/_jax`): DAG compiler mapping modeling expressions to JAX primitives, JIT-compiled NLP evaluator (objective, gradient, Hessian, constraint Jacobian), McCormick convex/concave relaxations (19 functions), and a relaxation compiler with vmap support.

**Solver wrappers** (`python/discopt/solvers`): HiGHS LP wrapper with warm-start support, cyipopt NLP wrapper for Ipopt.

**Orchestrator** (`python/discopt/solver.py`): End-to-end `Model.solve()` connecting all components. At each B&B node: solve continuous NLP relaxation with tightened bounds, prune infeasible nodes, fathom integer-feasible solutions, branch on most fractional variable.

## Quick Start

```python
from discopt import Model

m = Model("example")
x = m.continuous("x", lb=0, ub=5)
y = m.continuous("y", lb=0, ub=5)
z = m.binary("z")

m.minimize(x**2 + y**2 + z)
m.subject_to(x + y >= 1)
m.subject_to(x**2 + y <= 3)

result = m.solve()
print(result.status)     # "optimal"
print(result.objective)  # 0.5
print(result.x)          # {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.5, "z": 0.0}
```

- Cutting planes (RLT, outer approximation)
- GNN-based branching policy

### Phase 4: Polish + Release

- Documentation + example notebooks
- Release engineering (`pip install discopt`)
