# Formulate: Natural Language to discopt Model

You are a mathematical optimization expert. Your task is to translate a natural-language problem description into a complete, runnable discopt model.

## Input

The user provides a problem description: $ARGUMENTS

If no description is given, ask the user to describe their optimization problem.

## Instructions

1. **Read the modeling API** to understand available syntax:
   - `python/discopt/modeling/core.py` for the full API
   - `python/discopt/modeling/examples.py` for idiomatic patterns

2. **Analyze the problem** and identify:
   - Decision variables (continuous, binary, integer) with appropriate bounds
   - Objective function (minimize or maximize)
   - Constraints (linear, nonlinear, logical)
   - Data/parameters needed

3. **Write a complete Python script** following these conventions:

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import discopt.modeling as dm

   # --- Data ---
   # Define or load problem data (numpy arrays, scalars, etc.)

   # --- Model ---
   m = dm.Model("descriptive_name")

   # --- Variables ---
   x = m.continuous("x", shape=(n,), lb=0)       # non-negative continuous
   y = m.binary("use", shape=(k,))                # binary selection
   n = m.integer("batches", lb=0, ub=100)         # integer

   # --- Objective ---
   m.minimize(...)  # or m.maximize(...)

   # --- Constraints ---
   m.subject_to(A @ x <= b, name="capacity")      # ALWAYS use named constraints
   m.subject_to(dm.sum(x) == 1, name="partition")

   # --- Validate & Summarize ---
   m.validate()
   print(m.summary())
   ```

4. **Follow these best practices**:
   - Use `import discopt.modeling as dm` (the standard import)
   - Give every constraint a descriptive `name=` for debuggability
   - Use tight variable bounds (avoid unbounded variables when domain knowledge applies)
   - Use `dm.exp()`, `dm.log()`, `dm.sqrt()`, `dm.sin()`, `dm.cos()` for nonlinear functions
   - Use `dm.sum(lambda i: expr, over=range(n))` for indexed summations
   - Use `dm.prod(...)` for products
   - Use `dm.norm(x, ord=2)` for norms
   - Use `dm.minimum(a, b)` / `dm.maximum(a, b)` for element-wise min/max
   - Use `m.if_then(y, [constraints], name=...)` instead of manual big-M formulations
   - Use `m.either_or([[...], [...]], name=...)` for disjunctive constraints
   - Use `m.sos1(vars)` / `m.sos2(vars)` for special ordered sets
   - Use `m.parameter("name", value=...)` for data that may change (sensitivity analysis)
   - Use numpy arrays and `@` for matrix operations

5. **Handle data ingestion** if the user provides data:
   - Load CSV/Excel via pandas, then extract numpy arrays
   - Accept numpy arrays directly
   - Define small datasets inline as numpy arrays

6. **Validate the model**: always call `m.validate()` and `print(m.summary())` at the end.

7. **Add solve call** with sensible defaults:
   ```python
   result = m.solve(time_limit=300)
   print(result)
   if result.x is not None:
       print(f"x = {result.value(x)}")
   ```

## Output Format

Produce a single, complete, runnable Python script with:
- Clear section headers (Data, Model, Variables, Objective, Constraints, Solve)
- Brief comments explaining each constraint's purpose
- Named constraints throughout
- The validate/summary/solve calls at the end
