"""Tests for the JAX-side wall-clock deadline plumbing (issue #80).

These verify that ``deadline_scope`` actually interrupts a JAX-compiled
``while_loop`` mid-execution, that an unset deadline leaves convergence
behavior unchanged, and that the host-callback predicate behaves on the
process-global state.
