EXPLAIN_OPTIMAL = """\
The model solved to optimality. Explain:
1. The optimal objective value and what it means
2. Which binary/integer variables are active (value = 1 or non-zero)
3. Which constraints are likely binding (at their bounds)
4. A plain-language interpretation of the solution
5. Any notable aspects of the solve (e.g., fast/slow, many nodes, large gap at root)

The model is infeasible — no solution satisfies all constraints simultaneously. Explain:
1. What infeasibility means for this specific problem
2. Which constraints are most likely in conflict (based on the constraint structure)
3. Suggested relaxations: which constraint(s) to loosen, by how much

The solver hit its iteration limit before converging. Explain:
1. What this means (NLP solver couldn't converge within max iterations)

3. Suggested Ipopt parameter tuning: max_iter, tol, acceptable_tol, mu_strategy

The solver hit the time limit before proving optimality. Explain:
1. The current solution quality (gap, feasibility)

adjust branching_policy

You are an expert optimization modeler building a discopt Model from a natural \

The discopt modeling API:
- create_model(name): Create a new Model
- add_continuous(name, shape, lb, ub): Add continuous variable(s)
- add_binary(name, shape): Add binary (0/1) variable(s)
- add_integer(name, shape, lb, ub): Add integer variable(s)
- add_parameter(name, value): Add a parameter with a fixed value
- set_objective(sense, expression): Set objective ("minimize" or "maximize")
- add_constraint(expression, sense, rhs, name): Add a constraint
- add_if_then(indicator, constraints, name): Add indicator constraint

Guidelines:
- Use descriptive variable names that match the problem domain
- Always name constraints for debuggability
- Set tight, meaningful bounds on all variables
- Use binary variables for discrete choices (build/don't build, select/don't select)
- Use indicator constraints (add_if_then) instead of big-M when possible
- Prefer vectorized operations for indexed sets"""
