"""GDP big-M vs. hull reformulation advisor (F1 of issue #53).

discopt-distinctive. ``_jax/gdp_reformulate.py`` already supports three
reformulation methods (``big-m``, ``mbigm``, ``hull``) but the choice is
fixed by the caller. This module makes the choice a *presolve decision*
driven by structural properties of each disjunction:

- **Hull** is the tightest LP relaxation but pays for it with
  disaggregated copies of every common variable per disjunct. It is
  exact for linear constraints and is asymptotically dominant when
  disjunctions are small and linear.
- **Big-M** introduces only one indicator per disjunct and at most a
  constant number of constraints per original constraint. It is
  *structurally* the cheapest option and the LP relaxation is
  competitive when M is naturally tight.
- **MBigM** keeps the big-M structure but solves an LP to tighten each
  M, recouping a fraction of the LP-tightness gap at one LP solve per
  active constraint.

The advisor inspects each ``_DisjunctiveConstraint`` and emits a
recommendation per disjunction, plus a diagnostic record explaining
which structural feature drove the choice.

    Attributes
    ----------
    disjunction_index : int
        Position of the disjunction in ``model._constraints``.
    name : Optional[str]
        Disjunction name, copied from the source constraint.
    recommendation : str
        One of ``"big-m"``, ``"hull"``, ``"mbigm"``.
    rationale : str
        Short human-readable explanation of which heuristic fired.
    n_disjuncts : int
        Number of disjuncts (branches) in the disjunction.
    n_common_vars : int
        Distinct continuous/integer variables appearing across disjuncts
        (the hull-disaggregation cost is driven by this).
    hull_aux_cost : int
        Number of disaggregated continuous variables hull would
        introduce: ``n_disjuncts * n_common_vars``.
    has_nonlinear : bool
        True iff any constraint body is non-linear (perspective hull
        is numerically tricky for these — big-M is usually preferred).
    max_big_m : float
        Largest big-M value over all disjunct constraints, computed via
        interval arithmetic. ``inf`` if any bound is unbounded.

    Heuristic order, mirroring the trade-offs in Grossmann & Trespalacios
    (2013) §4:

    1. If any disjunct contains a non-linear constraint, prefer
       ``big-m`` — perspective hull on non-linear bodies needs ε-clamping
       and is numerically delicate. Promote to ``mbigm`` if the body is
       bounded so the LP-tightening pays off.
    2. If hull's aux-variable cost (``n_disjuncts * n_common_vars``)
       exceeds ``hull_aux_budget``, fall back to ``big-m``/``mbigm`` even
       for linear disjunctions.
    3. Otherwise, with all-linear constraints and a manageable
       disaggregation cost, pick ``hull``: its LP relaxation strictly
       dominates and the cost is bounded.
    4. Within the big-M branch, choose ``mbigm`` over ``big-m`` when
       interval-arithmetic M is loose (max_M > threshold) — LP-based M
       tightening recovers most of the relaxation gap.
