"""
discopt -- Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming with JAX and Rust.

A hybrid MINLP solver combining a Rust backend (LP solving, Branch & Bound tree
management), JAX (automatic differentiation, NLP relaxations, GPU acceleration),
and Python orchestration.

Quick Start
-----------
>>> import discopt
>>> m = discopt.Model("example")
>>> x = m.continuous("x", shape=(2,), lb=0, ub=10)
>>> y = m.binary("y")
>>> m.minimize(x[0] + 2 * x[1] + 5 * y)
>>> m.subject_to(x[0] + x[1] >= 3)
>>> result = m.solve()

Submodules
----------
modeling
    Model building API: Model, Variable, Expression, Constraint, math functions.
solver
    Solve orchestrator: Branch & Bound with NLP relaxations.
solvers
    NLP solver backends: ripopt (Rust IPM), pure-JAX IPM (vmap batch), cyipopt (Ipopt).
