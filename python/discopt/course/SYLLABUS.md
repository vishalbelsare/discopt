# Syllabus

Thirty lessons in three tracks. Each row links the lesson directory and the
primary literature backing it (full BibTeX entries in `docs/references.bib`).

## Pacing

The course is self-paced. A reasonable target is **one lesson per week** for
basic, **one every 1-2 weeks** for intermediate, and **one every 2-3 weeks**
for advanced. The total course is roughly equivalent to a one-year graduate
sequence in optimization.

## Prerequisites

- **Basic**: calculus, linear algebra, comfort with Python.
- **Intermediate**: completion of basic track or equivalent (an undergraduate
  OR or convex optimization course).
- **Advanced**: completion of intermediate track and at least one of: a
  graduate optimization course, research experience, or significant industrial
  experience formulating MINLPs.

## Assessment

Each lesson awards up to 100 points distributed across exercise correctness,
writing quality, and (on capstones) experimental rigor. The `course-assessor`
skill normalizes grading across sessions. Track completion requires ≥ 70 / 100
on every lesson.
