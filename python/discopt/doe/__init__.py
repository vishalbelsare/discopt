"""discopt.doe -- Model-based Design of Experiments.

Optimal experimental design using Fisher Information Matrix analysis
with exact JAX autodiff for sensitivity computation.

Quick Start
-----------
>>> from discopt.doe import compute_fim, optimal_experiment, DesignCriterion
>>> fim_result = compute_fim(experiment, param_values, design_values)
>>> design = optimal_experiment(experiment, param_values, design_bounds)
>>> print(design.summary())
