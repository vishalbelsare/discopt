# discopt: Unified Publication Roadmap

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Synthesized from:** Three independent reviewer reports (methods, applications, software/infrastructure)

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap consolidates findings from three scientific reviewers into a unified publication strategy spanning the 42-month discopt development plan. The strategy identifies **22 distinct publication opportunities** (plus 1 open-source release milestone) organized into **5 tiers** by priority and timing:

1. **Tier 1 — Foundation** (Months 6-14): Establish priority, claim intellectual territory, publish first algorithmic results
2. **Tier 2 — Flagship Methods** (Months 14-22): The core algorithmic contributions at top venues
3. **Tier 3 — Application Demonstrations** (Months 14-30): Domain papers proving the value propositions
4. **Tier 4 — Software & Advanced Methods** (Months 20-36): Software formalization, deeper algorithmic contributions
5. **Tier 5 — Capstone** (Months 28-42): Platform maturity, research platform demonstration

**Realistic target**: 12-16 published papers over 42 months (not all 22 — some are alternatives for the same slot). A strong outcome is **4 top-venue papers** (NeurIPS/ICML/Nature-family), **4-5 domain journal papers**, **2-3 optimization computation papers**, and **1-2 software/tutorial papers**.

## The Three Value Propositions and Their Paper Families

Every discopt paper demonstrates one or more of three unique capabilities:

| Value Proposition | Key JAX Feature | Becomes Available | Paper Family |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Batch solving** | `jax.vmap` | Phase 2 (~Month 14) | Batch B&B, portfolio, batch BO, autonomous experiments, molecular screening |
| **Differentiability** | `jax.grad` / `custom_jvp` | Phase 2 (~Month 18) | Differentiable MINLP, DFL/ChemE, inverse design, energy dispatch |
| **JAX composability** | `jit`, ecosystem | Phase 1 (~Month 10) | McCormick compiler, systems architecture, JOSS, tutorial |

---

## Tier 1 — Foundation (Months 6-14)

These papers establish discopt's existence and claim intellectual territory before the solver is competitive.

### 1. Workshop Paper: Batch Spatial B&B on GPU via JAX
- **Month**: 6-8 (submittable with partial Phase 1 results)
- **Venue**: NeurIPS OPT Workshop or ICML Workshop on Computational Optimization
- **Contribution**: Introduce the batch B&B architecture — Rust tree management + JAX vmap node evaluation
- **Minimum results**: 5+ MINLPLib instances solved, batch speedup at sizes 32-512, architectural spike data
- **Strategic value**: Establishes priority, 4-6 page extended abstract, fast turnaround (~2 months). NOT prior publication at NeurIPS/ICML for later full papers
- **Dependencies**: T0, T4-T6, T11-T12, T14 (partial)

### 2. Position Paper: Differentiable Discrete Optimization for Scientific ML
- **Month**: 8-12 (primarily conceptual, minimal code required)
- **Venue**: arXiv preprint → AAAI AI4Science Workshop or NeurIPS AI4Science
- **Contribution**: Survey the gap between differentiable optimization and integer programming; catalog scientific ML workflows needing differentiable MINLP; present discopt's multi-level framework
- **Minimum results**: Literature survey (100+ papers), capability gap matrix, conceptual architecture, optional small demo
- **Strategic value**: Claims intellectual territory for "differentiable discrete optimization for scientific ML." Becomes the cited reference. Directly supports grant applications (NSF CSSI, DOE ASCR)
- **Dependencies**: Literature review effort; benefits from T0 and T14 but not strictly required

### 3. McCormick-to-JAX Compiler Paper
- **Month**: 8-10 (end of Phase 1)
- **Venue**: INFORMS Journal on Computing (IJOC) or Mathematical Programming Computation (MPC)
- **Contribution**: Compiler that walks expression DAGs and emits pure `jax.numpy` McCormick relaxations — first system making McCormick automatically JIT-compilable, vmappable, and differentiable
- **Minimum results**: 14 operation types pass 10K-point soundness test; 24 MINLPLib instances produce valid relaxations; `jax.grad` matches finite differences; vmap scaling on GPU
- **Strategic value**: First peer-reviewed algorithmic contribution. Establishes the compilation approach that all later papers build on. MPC requires open-source, aligning with discopt's license
- **Dependencies**: T4, T5, T6, T15, T10

### 4. Open-Source Release (not a paper — enables JOSS clock)
- **Month**: ~10 (at or shortly after Phase 1 gate)
- **Action**: Make the repository public on GitHub. This starts the 6-month maintenance clock required by JOSS
- **Strategic value**: Enables community feedback, signals commitment, and begins the JOSS eligibility period. Methods papers [5, 6] can reference the open-source repo with a GitHub URL or Zenodo DOI before JOSS is published
- **Note**: JOSS submission moves to Month 20-24 (see Paper 17 in Tier 4)

---

## Tier 2 — Flagship Methods (Months 14-22)

These are the highest-impact contributions targeting top ML and optimization venues.

### 5. Batch Spatial B&B Architecture (Full Paper)
- **Month**: 14-16 (early Phase 2)
- **Venue**: NeurIPS or ICML (main conference)
- **Contribution**: First MINLP solver to evaluate hundreds of B&B nodes in parallel on GPU. Restructures the inherently sequential B&B into "batch-sequential" pattern. Demonstrates Rust (CPU tree) + JAX (GPU relaxation) split
- **Minimum results**: 24 MINLPLib correct, >=15x GPU speedup at batch 512, >=200 nodes/sec, interop overhead <=5%, comparison to Couenne (<=3x), batch size ablation
- **Strategic value**: Flagship architecture paper. Frames as enabling "optimization-in-the-loop ML," not just optimization speed
- **Dependencies**: T14, T15, T17, T19, T24, T25
- **Builds on**: Papers 1, 3

### 6. Differentiable MINLP via Multi-Level Gradients
- **Month**: 16-20 (mid-late Phase 2)
- **Venue**: NeurIPS or ICML (main conference)
- **Contribution**: Multi-level differentiability framework — Level 1 (LP relaxation sensitivity via `custom_jvp`), Level 3 (implicit differentiation at active set), perturbation smoothing fallback. First system providing gradients through MINLP solving
- **Minimum results**: Level 1 on 5+ parametric LP instances, Level 3 on 5 MINLP problems, perturbation smoothing convergence, decision-focused learning demo, composability with vmap
- **Strategic value**: **Potentially the highest-impact publication.** Extends cvxpylayers/PyEPO to MINLP. NeurIPS/ICML have published all key differentiable optimization papers
- **Dependencies**: T14, T22, T23, T19
- **Builds on**: Papers 3, 5

### 7. Ipopt-to-Rust Translation: A Memory-Safe Interior Point Method
- **Month**: 12-20 (Phase 1-2, can begin early as infrastructure work)
- **Venue**: Mathematical Programming Computation (MPC), Optimization Methods and Software (OMS), or SoftwareX
- **Contribution**: A faithful translation of Ipopt's core interior point algorithm from C++ to Rust, producing a standalone, memory-safe NLP solver. Rather than designing a novel IPM from scratch — with all the risk of subtle numerical bugs and years of missed edge cases — this approach preserves 20+ years of hardened algorithmic engineering (filter line search, inertia correction, warm-starting, restoration phase) while gaining Rust's safety guarantees and modern tooling
- **Why translation over from-scratch**:
  1. **De-risking**: Ipopt handles hundreds of numerical edge cases accumulated over two decades (degenerate Jacobians, rank-deficient KKT systems, cycling detection, tiny step recovery). A from-scratch IPM would rediscover these failures one benchmark at a time. Translation preserves this institutional knowledge
  2. **Correctness by construction**: Each translated function can be validated against Ipopt's own output on the same problem instance, providing a natural regression test suite. Bit-for-bit matching on well-conditioned problems, tolerance matching on ill-conditioned ones
  3. **Path to vmappability**: Once the core algorithm is in Rust with explicit state, refactoring for batch execution (struct-of-arrays layout, removing global state, parameterizing over problem data) is substantially easier than wrapping C++ Ipopt through FFI. The Rust version becomes the foundation for a vmappable JAX IPM — the translation is Phase 1 scaffolding that evolves into Phase 2 infrastructure rather than being discarded
  4. **Community value**: There is no production-quality Rust NLP solver. A Rust Ipopt would be immediately useful to the growing Rust scientific computing ecosystem (Argmin, Russell, faer), independent of discopt
  5. **Maintenance**: Rust's ownership model eliminates use-after-free and data races that have caused real Ipopt bugs. `cargo clippy` and `miri` catch entire categories of issues at compile time
  6. **LLM-assisted translation**: Modern LLMs can accelerate C++-to-Rust translation significantly, making this more feasible now than even two years ago. The structured, algorithmic nature of Ipopt's code (numerical linear algebra, iterative loops, well-defined interfaces) is particularly amenable to automated translation
- **EPL-2.0 licensing issue**: Ipopt is licensed under the Eclipse Public License 2.0. A line-by-line translation to Rust is almost certainly a derivative work under copyright law, meaning the Rust translation must also be distributed under EPL-2.0 (or a compatible secondary license if the original contributors designate one). **This creates a license boundary within discopt**: the Rust Ipopt module would be EPL-2.0, while the rest of discopt could remain MIT/Apache-2.0. Options:
  - **(a) Dual-module licensing** (recommended): Keep the Rust Ipopt as a separate crate (`ripopt`) under EPL-2.0. discopt depends on it but is not itself EPL-covered. EPL-2.0 explicitly permits this — it is not a "viral" license like GPL. The Ipopt crate is a separately distributable component with its own license
  - **(b) Clean-room reimplementation**: Study Ipopt's algorithms from published papers (Wächter & Biegler 2006, SIAM J. Optimization), then reimplement from the mathematical description without reference to source code. Produces a fully MIT-licensable result but loses the edge-case hardening and is higher risk
  - **(c) Upstream relicensing**: Contact COIN-OR / Ipopt maintainers about adding MIT/Apache as a secondary license under EPL-2.0 Section 3. Worth attempting but unlikely to succeed quickly for a codebase with many contributors
  - **(d) Functional API boundary**: If the translation produces a solver with a sufficiently different internal architecture (e.g., different data structures, different memory layout, different linear algebra backend), it may qualify as an independent implementation inspired by the same algorithms. Legal gray area — requires counsel
- **Minimum results**: Matches Ipopt's C++ output on all 7 NLP benchmark problems (rel_tol=1e-6); matches on all 7 Netlib LP instances; passes Ipopt's own test suite (translated); handles at least 3 failure-mode tests (degenerate, unbounded, infeasible) correctly; wall-clock within 2x of C++ Ipopt on single instances (Rust overhead acceptable given safety benefits); clean `cargo clippy`, zero `unsafe` in core algorithm
- **Stretch results**: vmappable Rust IPM that can batch-solve via JAX integration (>=10x at batch 64), differentiable via `custom_jvp`
- **Strategic value**: **This is the lowest-risk path to a GPU-native subsolver.** Translation gives a correct baseline immediately; optimization for batching/GPU comes afterward from a known-good starting point. The alternative — building a custom dense GPU IPM from scratch — is higher novelty but also higher risk of subtle numerical failures that only manifest on hard MINLPLib instances at Phase 2/3 gates
- **Dependencies**: Ipopt source code (publicly available), Rust toolchain, faer or nalgebra for linear algebra
- **Builds on**: Papers 3, 5

## Credibility Cascade

Publications are sequenced so that methods papers establish the intellectual contribution first, and the JOSS software paper formalizes the artifact afterward:

```
[1] Workshop ─── establishes the idea, gets name out
 │
[2] Position ─── claims intellectual territory, supports grants
 │
[3] McCormick ── first algorithmic contribution (optimization journal)
 │
[4] Open-source release ── starts JOSS 6-month maintenance clock
 │  \
 │   [8] Solver announcement ── citable reference until JOSS
 │
[5] Batch B&B ── flagship architecture (top ML venue)
 │  \
 │   [9] Portfolio ── quick application win (vmap demo)
 │
[6] Diff MINLP ─ flagship methods (top ML venue)
 │  \
 │   [12] DFL ChemE ── differentiability in domain context
 │
[17] JOSS ─────── formalizes software after methods prove the contribution
 │
[18] Benchmark ── solver credentialed by optimization community
 │
[19] Tutorial ── onboards practitioners
 │  \
 │   [15] Inverse design ── all value propositions combined
 │
[21] GNN branch ─ demonstrates research platform capability
```

**Sequencing rationale**: Methods papers [5, 6] come before JOSS because (a) JOSS now requires 6 months of open-source maintenance history, and (b) the algorithmic contributions are the real intellectual advances — JOSS formalizes the software artifact after those contributions are established. Methods papers can reference the open-source repository via GitHub URL or Zenodo DOI. The solver announcement paper [8] or arXiv preprint serves as a citable reference in the interim.

## Collaboration Requirements

Each application paper benefits from domain expert co-authors. Recruiting should begin in Months 10-14 (while Phase 2 work proceeds):

| Paper | Domain Expert Needed | When to Recruit |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| [9] Portfolio | Quantitative finance researcher | Month 10 |
| [10] Batch BO | Materials scientist (alloy/composition) | Month 10 |
| [11] Autonomous experiments | Experimental chemist (autonomous lab) | Month 12 |
| [12] DFL ChemE | Chemical engineer (process synthesis) | Month 12 |
| [13] Molecular screening | Computational chemist (QSPR) | Month 16 |
| [14] Energy dispatch | Power systems engineer | Month 18 |
| [15] Inverse design | Materials scientist (DFT + ML) | Month 18 |

---

## Grant Alignment

| Grant Program | Typical Deadline | Supporting Publications at Submission |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| NSF CSSI Elements | October annually | [1] workshop, [2] position, [3] McCormick, [8] solver announcement |
| DOE ASCR Applied Math | February annually | [1], [2], [3], open-source repo |
| CZI EOSS Cycle 7+ | June annually | [1], [2], [3], open-source repo with 6+ months history |
| NSF CSSI Framework (renewal) | October (Year 3+) | [5]-[6], [9]-[12], [17] JOSS, [18] benchmark — full portfolio |

For early grant submissions (Month 14-18), the position paper [2], McCormick compiler [3], and open-source repo with active development history provide strong evidence of vision and capability. Methods papers [5, 6] may be submitted/under review by then, demonstrable as preprints.

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Phase 1 delayed → methods papers delayed | HIGH — pushes entire cascade | [1] workshop and [2] position proceed independently; [3] McCormick compiler has fewer dependencies |
| BARON comparison unfavorable | MEDIUM — weakens [18] | Frame around batch/diff capabilities, not single-instance speed |
| Differentiability (Level 3) proves harder than expected | MEDIUM — weakens [6], [12], [15] | Scope [6] to Level 1 only; [15] becomes future work |
| Competing work (PyTorch MINLP solver) appears | MEDIUM — reduces novelty | Accelerate [2] position paper for priority; [1] provides timestamp |
| Cannot recruit domain collaborators | MEDIUM — blocks application papers | Start with [9] portfolio (no collaborator strictly needed) and [12] ChemE (closest to existing codebase examples) |
| GPU speedup <15x | LOW — weakens [5] | Architecture contribution stands even at 5-10x; honest reporting |
| JOSS maintenance requirement not met | LOW — delays [17] | Open-source early (Month 10); active issue tracking and community engagement during Phases 1-2 builds the required history naturally |

## Summary: Realistic 42-Month Publication Output

**Conservative estimate** (12 papers):
- 2 workshop papers [1, +1 NeurIPS ML4CO at Month 26]
- 1 position paper [2]
- 2 top-venue methods papers [5, 6]
- 2 optimization computation papers [3, 18]
- 3 domain application papers [9, 10, 12]
- 1 JOSS paper [17]
- 1 tutorial [19]

**Optimistic estimate** (16 papers):
- Add [7] GPU IPM, [11] autonomous experiments, [15] inverse design, [21] GNN branching

This represents a strong publication record for a 3.5-year computational infrastructure project and supports both tenure cases and grant renewals.
